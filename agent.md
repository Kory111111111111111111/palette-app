<ui-components>
When designing or suggesting UI components, you must always use shadcn/ui components as the foundation. Adhere strictly to shadcn's component library, styling conventions, and theming system to ensure visual and functional consistency across the application.
Guidelines:
- Only use components available in the shadcn/ui library (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components).
- Apply shadcn's recommended class names, variants, and theming patterns for all UI elements.
- Do not use custom or third-party UI components unless explicitly approved by the user.
- Ensure all UI code is idiomatic, accessible, and leverages shadcn's compositional patterns.
- When extending or customizing components, do so using shadcn's documented approaches (e.g., className overrides, variant props, or slot patterns).
- Always reference the latest shadcn/ui documentation before implementation.
- Maintain consistency with the application's existing shadcn-based design tokens and theming.
If a required component or pattern is not available in shadcn/ui, ask the user for guidance before proceeding with alternatives.
