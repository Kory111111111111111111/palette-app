## Technical Differences

### AI Mode (Under the Hood)
```typescript
// Sends prompt to Gemini API
const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
// AI analyzes context and generates palette
// Returns JSON with colors and reasoning
```

### Algorithmic Mode (Under the Hood)
```typescript
// Calculates harmony angles
const harmonies = generateHarmonyColors(baseColor, 'complementary');
// Applies color theory rules
// Assigns to UI roles with WCAG checks
// Returns structured palette
```
