# Cognitive Load Reduction Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to address the 10 identified cognitive load issues in the Palette Generator application. The plan maintains all existing features while restructuring the user experience to reduce mental effort through progressive disclosure, clear information hierarchy, and simplified interaction patterns.

**Key Principles Applied:**
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- One primary action per screen/context
- Clear visual hierarchy and grouping
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Contextual help and guidance
- Reduced choice paralysis through smart defaults

## Issue 1: Overwhelming State Management Complexity

**Current Problem:** 13 state variables create mental overhead as users track multiple application states simultaneously.

**Solution Strategy:** Implement a state management hierarchy with clear user journey stages.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:

1. **Create User Journey Context Provider**
   - Use `createContext` to manage application state
   - Define clear journey stages: `exploring` → `creating` → `refining` → `exporting`
   - Each stage shows only relevant controls and information

2. **Implement State Reducer Pattern**
   - Create a state reducer that manages transitions between journey stages
   - Use `useReducer` hook for complex state logic
   - Define state transitions that automatically hide/show relevant UI elements

3. **Progressive UI Rendering**
   - Create conditional rendering components that show different layouts based on journey stage
   - Use `AnimatePresence` from Framer Motion for smooth transitions between states
   - Implement breadcrumb navigation to show current stage

4. **Contextual Modal Management**
   - Create a modal queue system using `Dialog` components
   - Only allow one modal at a time, with clear back/next navigation
   - Use modal stacking with proper z-index management

### Shadcn Components Used:
- `Dialog` for modal management
- `Breadcrumb` for navigation context
- `Tabs` for journey stage indication
- `Progress` to show completion status

### Expected Benefits:
- Users understand exactly where they are in the process
- Reduced mental load from tracking multiple concurrent states
- Clear path forward at each stage

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:

1. **Create Action Priority Groups**
   - Primary actions: Save, Generate (always visible)
   - Secondary actions: Load, Compare (contextual)
   - Tertiary actions: Export, Settings (hidden in menu)

2. **Implement Smart Action Bar**
   - Use `Toolbar` component with collapsible sections
   - Show 2-3 primary actions by default
   - Add "More Actions" dropdown for secondary/tertiary actions

3. **Contextual Action Visibility**
   - Show "Compare" only when palettes exist
   - Show "Export" only when current palette has colors
   - Use `Tooltip` to explain action availability

4. **Responsive Action Layout**
   - Desktop: Horizontal toolbar with all actions
   - Mobile: Collapsible action menu using `Sheet` component
   - Tablet: Condensed horizontal layout

### Shadcn Components Used:
- `Toolbar` for action organization
- `DropdownMenu` for secondary actions
- `Tooltip` for contextual help
- `Sheet` for mobile responsive design
- `Badge` to show action states

### Expected Benefits:
- Clear primary actions reduce decision fatigue
- Contextual visibility prevents irrelevant options
- Consistent action placement across devices
